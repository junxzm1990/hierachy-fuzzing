      <h1>The African American Toast Tradition</h1>
      <p>By Mona Lisa Saloy</p>
	
  
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As evidenced in print and
      music, African Americans boast a lively verbal art tradition
      that includes tales, toasts, and adventures of bad guys who confront
      and vanquish any adversary instantly and guiltlessly. From Reconstruction
      to the jazz age through today, this boasting tradition has been
      a uniquely urban phenomenon. </p>

      <p>&quot;Toasts&quot; are performed
      narratives of often urban but always heroic events. For many
      Blacks, both performers and audience, hearing about or performing
      the winning ways of the central character becomes as creative
      a release as Black music. Toasting is today's continuance of
      an oral tradition, but many contemporary toasters read their
      complicated and elaborate versions from a text. As with any oral
      tradition, many versions of the same toast exist. The toast is
      a dynamic performance within the Black community of recognizable
      and popular central characters. They are performed in bars, libraries,
      community centers, and even college campuses. However, less explicit
      toasts are performed by anyone at any time for entertainment.
      </p>

      <p>A toast well known in any
      large American city with a significant Black population is &quot;Shine
      and the Titanic.&quot; This toast relates the heroic efforts
      of an old Black stoker to warn of the ship's impending disaster,
      but when ignored, he strives to save himself. The Titanic sank
      on its maiden voyage in 1912, during the Jim Crow days when Blacks
      were not allowed as passengers. </p>

      <p>Toasts are typical of other
      Black traditions, such as quilting and gospel, in that improvisation
      is highly valued. Therefore, one will find many different versions
      of any toast; many use profane street speech. This version of
      &quot;Shine and the Titanic&quot; heard by the author in Oakland,
      California, has been edited for publication. </p>

      <p>In toasts, historical accuracy
      is not considered important. For instance, although in reality
      the Titanic sank in April, in the ballad it sinks in May. Audiences
      expect, accept, and appreciate the toaster's improvisations.
      </p>

      <p>As is common in toasts, a
      narrator describes Shines's successful exploits, while Shine
      directly addresses the captain, his daughter, and the whale.
      Shine, the black stoker and hero of the toast, repeatedly warns
      the white captain of the impending disaster and humbly gives
      updates on the sinking ship. Even though Shine is ignored, hustled,
      and chased by a whale, he remains confident of his ability and
      determination. It is Shine alone who can save the day. </p>

<blockquote>
      <p><em>Shine and the Titanic</em></p>

      <p>It was a hell of a day in
      the merry month of May<br>
      When the great Titanic was sailing away.<br>
      The captain and his daughter was there, too,<br>
      And old black Shine, he didn't need no crew.<br>
      Shine was downstairs eating his peas<br>
      When the . . .water come up to his knees.<br>
      He said, &quot;Captain, Captain, I was downstairs eating my peas
      When the water come up to my knees.&quot;<br>
      He said, &quot;Shine, Shine, set your black self down.<br>
      I got ninety-nine pumps to pump the water down.&quot;<br>
      Shine went downstairs looking through space.<br>
      That's when the water came up to his waist.<br>
      He said, &quot;Captain, Captain, I was downstairs looking through
      space,<br>
      That's when the water came up to my waist.&quot;<br>
      He said, &quot;Shine, Shine, set your black self down.<br>
      I got ninety-nine pumps to pump the water down.&quot;<br>
      Shine went downstairs, he ate a piece of bread.<br>
      That's when the water came above his head.<br>
      He said, &quot;Captain, Captain, I was downstairs eating my bread<br>
      And the . . .water came above my head.&quot;<br>
      He said, &quot;Shine, Shine, set your black self down.<br>
      I got ninety-nine pumps to pump the water down.&quot;<br>
      Shine took off his shirt, took a dive. He took one stroke <br>
      And the water pushed him like it pushed a motorboat.<br>
      I'll give you more money than any black man see.&quot;<br>
      Shine said, &quot;Money is good on land or sea.<br>
      Take off your shirt and swim like me.&quot;<br>
      And Shine Swam on.<br>
      Shine met up with the whale.<br>
      The whale said, &quot;Shine, Shine, you swim mighty fine,<br>
      But if you miss one stroke, your black self is mine.&quot;<br>
      Shine said, &quot;You may be the king of the ocean, king of the
      sea,<br>
      But you got to be a swimming son-of-a-gun to out-swim me.&quot;<br>
      And Shine swam on.<br>
      Now when the news got to the port, the great Titanic has sunk,<br>
      You won't believe this, but old Shine was on the corner damn
      near drunk.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p>As popular a toast as &quot;Shine
      and the Titanic,&quot; &quot;The Signifying Monkey&quot; is an
      animal tale that occurs in many versions. The following is a
      child's version of this popular toast.</p>

	    <blockquote>  
	  <em><p>The Signifying Monkey</p></em>
 
 <p>The Monkey and the Lion<br>
      Got to talking one day.<br>
      Monkey looked down and said, Lion,<br>
      I hear you's a king in every way.<br>
      But I know somebody<br>
      Who do not think that is true--<br>
      He told me he could whip<br>
      The living daylights out of you.</p>
</blockquote>


      <p>A New Orleans toaster, Christopher
      Wilkinson, defines the toast as a mostly male event. Wilkinson
      is aware that some women and men are often offended by versions
      including profanity, negative views of Black women, or sexual
      explicitness. However, he feels that most men find a release
      and celebration in the heroic deeds of the central character
      in the toast. The toaster relates to Shine's fantastic heroic
      feats. In the case of the Signifying Monkey, a continuously grueling
      verbal duel is in process with the little but clever Monkey instigating,
      taking knocks but getting up like a champ. Blacks celebrate the
      uplift the accomplishments bring, however fanciful. He/Shine
      was the hero; the Black man wins for a change. In a society imposing
      siege upon Black men (there are more Black men in prison than
      in college), toasting becomes a creative and liberating experience.
      In toasts, a Black does the &quot;top talking&quot; and the winning.
      As a result, the toast tradition has survived as a folk event
      because it provide s cultural identification and reinforcement
      for participants. </p>

      <p>For this year's festival two New Orleans toasters will be presented:
      Arthur Pfister and Christopher Wilkinson. Christopher Wilkinson,
      born in New Orleans but raised in Bunkie, is a toaster in the
      more traditional sense. His training was strictly verbal from
      another toaster. Wilkinson learned some toasts by heart and presents
      them with a lot of heart. He performs &quot;Dolomite&quot;, &quot;Shine,&quot;
      and a version of the &quot;Signifying Monkey.&quot; As a family
      man and sanitation worker in New Orleans, Wilkinson's performances are usually for family, friends, and associates. They tend
      to be male, since as he says most women, especially in Catholic/Baptist
      New Orleans, are often offended. Christopher Wilkinson will deliver
      a lively and entertaining, but self-censured, performance. </p>

      <p>On the other hand, Arthur
      Pfister is a working professional who teaches English for the
      Urban League in New Orleans. Pfister performs his own New Orleans
      version of &quot;Shine and the Titanic,&quot; and he composes
      his own toasts such as &quot;The Ballad of Billy Bob&quot; and
      its X-rated counterpart &quot;The Ballad of Nigger Bob.&quot;
      Pfister is also a poet and fiction writer born in New Orleans
      at Charity Hospital, he adds. He is the author of a published
      volume of poetry, <i>Beer Cans, Bullets, Things, and Pieces</i>
      with an introduction by Amiri Baraka. He is an editor, speech
      writer, graphic designer, and professor who received a Master
      of Arts in Writing from John Hopkins University and a Bachelor
      of Arts degree in Journalism from the State University of New
      York. Pfister is also a former Writer-in-Residence at Texas Southern
      University. His works have appeared in <i>Farhari </i>(&quot;pride&quot;
      in Kiswahili), <i>The American Poetry Review, The Minnesota Review</i>,
      and others. He received a Discovery Grant from the National Endowment
      of the Arts, and he served as visiting poet at Northeastern University's
      Afro American Studies Center. </p>

      <p>An unusual quality of Pfister's
      is his appeal to audiences with any lecture, speech, poem, or
      toast. Arthur Pfister is a well-known performer on radio, television,
      at community centers, libraries, and cultural events. His is
      an ongoing contribution to African American oral and literary
      traditions. </p>

      <p>Both Wilkinson and Pfister
      regard themselves as tradition-bearers, and their communities
      revere them as toasters as well. They enjoy performing toasts,
      and intend to keep this tradition alive. </p>

      <p>To date, important research
      on versions of Shine and the toast tradition is available (Jackson
      1974, Abrahams 1970). But additional research is needed to answer
      questions about this oral tradition. Some questions for this
      year's audience to consider are: How widespread a tradition is
      toasting in Louisiana? Does toasting occur in rural areas in
      this state? Are toasters found outside New Orleans in smaller
      cities? Are there women toasters? Do these toasters predict a
      change in the toast tradition? If so, what changes should we
      expect? Will media ever replace the need to toast? </p>

      <p>Perhaps, this year's presentation
      of the toast tradition in Louisiana will not only document the
      occurrence of this continuing dynamic tradition, but may attempt
      to address these issues.<br>
